My name is Nicklas, and I was born in 2010. I am a modern web developer, primarily backend.
I currently hold the rank of Junior Developer in Backend development using Python FastAPI.
My main languages are Python (for backend, FastAPI or Django) and JavaScript (TypeScript for websites).
I am currently studying and working in Germany.
